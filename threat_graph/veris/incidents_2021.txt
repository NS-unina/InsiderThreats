summary = PHETCHABUN: Officials have rushed to downplay the theft by a hacker of more than 10,000 patients' personal details from Phetchabun Hospital, describing the information as "not important".  Phetchabun governor Krit Kongmuang was among those who responded to initial reports on social media that the data of 16 million patients of the Public Health Ministry had been hacked and put up for sale on Sunday.  On Tuesday morning Mr Krit quoted the Phetchabun public health office as reporting that data was lost from Phetchabun Hospital, but involved nowhere near as many as 16 million patients. It was only records of patient admissions and discharges, he said. It was not important.  "There will be an investigation and legal action," the Phetchabun governor said.  The provincial health office did not yet know if or how the stolen information was used, he said.  Reports on social media said the personal information of about 16 million patients of the Public Health Ministry had been stolen and put up for sale for US$500, to be paid in a crypto currency.  Dr Thongchai Keeratihattayakorn, deputy permanent secretary for public health, said at the Public Health Ministry in Nonthaburi in the afternoon that the hacked information was not in the primary database the hospital used to provide public services, and the hospital continued to operate as normal.  The details were in files stored on a separate server used by hospital staff in their daily tasks, he said.  "It did not contain information about patient treatment or results of laboratory tests," Dr Thongchai said.  "It only showed if doctors' inspection charts were completed. The data relates to 10,095 patients and includes names, family names, dates of admission and discharge," Dr Thongchai said.  He then admitted the stolen data also included diagnoses of patients' symptoms.  Possible damage included misuse of the stolen names, family names, phone numbers and medical welfare details, he said.  Hacked information also included databases of patient appointments, names, family names and phone numbers, along with doctors' shifts and the cost of orthopaedic surgery for 692 patients at the hospital.  The risks posed by the theft were still being studied. The data was backed up. The  hospital's information system was being examined, Dr Thongchai said.  He apologised for the incident.  Dr Anant Kanoksilp, information technology director at the Public Health Ministry, said the web-based database that was hacked used an open source programme and was vulnerable. Other servers used by the hospital were not hacked, he said.  The attacked server had been disconnected from the outside and the attacker had not demanded any ransom from the hospital, Dr Anant said.  Sutthipong Wasusophaphon, deputy secretary-general of the National Health Commission, said that personal health data was confidential and could not be legally disclosed except under specific conditions.  Breaches could cause damage and infringe on individuals’ rights. Penaties included a prison term of up to six months and/or a fine of 10,000 baht under the National Health Act, he said.

summary = At the end of May, the municipal administration of the tranquil town of Rolle in French-speaking Switzerland was the victim of a cyber attack. This became known to the public recently through research on the news portal watson.ch. The result of the attack: The data of all residents and other documents have been quite easy to find on the Darknet since mid-June, according to Watson.   Numerous sensitive data stocks now in the Darknet The news portal reports of a “massive data leak” and a “large amount of internal and confidential documents” that are accessible on the Darknet. Several media outlets investigated and found, in addition to detailed personal data on residents and those of community employees and companies, the Outlook mailboxes of the former mayor and the head of administration as well as documents on the community’s financial planning. Even certificates with school grades from schoolchildren and information from children who were infected with the coronavirus can now be found on the Darknet. The annual assessments and comments can be seen from the community employees, writes the NZZ. Presumably, according to Watson, the criminals were able to access a server in the community for a long time and extract large amounts of data unnoticed.   The city council of Rolle initially claimed to Watson that it had no knowledge of a cyber attack, writes the news portal. Confronted by Watson with documents from the Darknet, the local government initially refused to comment. Then, last weekend, Mayor Monique Choulat-Pugnale finally admitted to the Vaud daily 24 heures that she had discovered a break in her IT systems at the end of May.Cyber ​​criminals entered the community’s computer network via ransomware attacks – presumably through a vulnerability in the operating system. The mayor stressed that the community had not paid a ransom. But it was only a “minor attack”. Only e-mails that contained “no sensitive data” were hacked, the president said. According to 24 heures, the mayor is also responsible for the IT systems of the community in Rolle. In a press release, the community finally announced that it had completely restored the data from current backups. But that was apparently difficult because the perpetrators had encrypted data on some administration servers and prevented access.   With the support of the Federal Computer Emergency Center (GovCERT), the Cantonal Police of Vaud and a specialized company, the IT systems were restored. However, this took ten days. Meanwhile, according to media reports, the community withheld the scope of the incident from the public – “on the advice of cybersecurity experts and in order not to increase the community’s vulnerability”.  Cyber ​​criminals likely took advantage of “PrintNightmare” vulnerability An IT specialist turned to Le Temps and reported that he had discovered an Excel table on the Darknet with the sometimes sensitive data of 5393 residents of the community. The newspaper then exposed the full extent of the attack, thereby confirming the Watson article.  The Watson journalists attribute the attack to the cyber criminal group “Vice Society”, which, according to the IT security experts at Cisco Talos, specializes in attacks on small and medium-sized companies as well as on public institutions. The one used by the cyber criminals Ransomware is said to use the “PrintNightmare” vulnerability in the Windows printing system to have. Vice Society ransomware has been detected by experts since June and, according to their findings, is a variant of “HelloKitty” ransomware, which is also used for attacks on Windows and Linux IT systems, primarily for small to medium-sized targets.

summary = Oshawa is sending some senior staff back to school for a refresher course on its Privacy Breach Response Policy and Procedure after private information was “inadvertently” leaked internally this summer.Fire Chief Derrick Clark sent a copy of an Excel file entitled ‘2021 Master Sick Report’ via email to Commissioner of Community Services Ron Diskey on August 6.  The document included a listing of the names of all members of Fire Services staff who have taken time off due to illness in 2021, affecting a total of 160 City staff. The document also included associated dates for sick days/leave, as well as more specific details in some cases, such as the reason for the absence.   Diskey, who has worked for the City for nearly 40 years, replied to Clark’s email in a forward to all members of the Corporate Leadership Team but inadvertently included a copy of the Master Sick Report. In response to receipt of the email and attachment, the incident was reported to the City Clerk and Information, Access and Privacy Officer that day.  The City Clerk received confirmation from all members of the Corporate Leadership Team that the record at issue has been destroyed. Additionally, several members of the Corporate Leadership Team confirmed that they did not open the attachment and didn’t see the personal information.

summary = According to Bleeping Computer, Gigabyte was the target of a ransomware attack last week and are currently being blackmailed with the exposure of 112GB of the stolen data.  The corporation announced that it shut down its IT infrastructure and that a small number of servers were impacted, but there are indications that the attack was more widespread. Multiple websites owned by the company were also affected by the incident, including its support site and elements of the company's Chinese website.  RansomEXX claimed to have taken 112GB of sensitive internal data as well as information from the American Megatrends Git Repository, among other things. Intel and AMD processors details as well as a debug document are suspected to be among the sensitive info. Although Gigabyte has said it plans to report the theft to authorities, the company did not provide any clues on whether they intend to pay the ransom.  The ransom note contains a link to a private page that only the victim is supposed to access to test decrypting a single file and leave an email address so that negotiations for the ransom can begin. Taiwanese motherboard maker Gigabyte has been hit by the RansomEXX ransomware gang, who threaten to publish 112GB of stolen data unless a ransom is paid.  Gigabyte is best known for its motherboards, but also manufactures other computer components and hardware, such as graphics cards, data center servers, laptops, and monitors. The attack occurred late Tuesday night into Wednesday and forced the company to shut down systems in Taiwan. The incident also affected multiple websites of the company, including its support site and portions of the Taiwanese website While Gigabyte has not officially stated what ransomware operation performed the attack, BleepingComputer has learned it was conducted by the RansomEXX gang.  When the RansomEXX operators encrypt a network, they will create ransom notes on each encrypted device.  These ransom notes contain a link to a non-public page meant to only be accessible to the victim to test the decryption of one file and to leave an email address to begin ransom negotiations.  Today, a source sent BleepingComputer a link to a non-public RansomEXX leak page for Gigabytes Technologies, where the threat actors claim to have stolen 112GB of data during the attack.

summary = Thousands of New York residents who live in buildings run by Douglas Elliman’s property management arm may have had their personal information compromised this month.  Douglas Elliman Property Management’s three managing directors emailed hundreds of co-operative and condominium boards Monday to advise them that the company’s IT network — which contains data for its buildings’ residents and employees — was breached and their personal information may have been compromised.   In the message viewed by The Real Deal, executives said the firm detected “suspicious activity” on its IT systems April 7. After launching an investigation and contacting law enforcement, Elliman determined that an “unauthorized party” gained access to its IT network between April 5 and April 7 and including files containing owners’ and employees’ personal data. A source with knowledge of the situation said the Federal Bureau of Investigation is involved.  Information that may have been compromised includes names, dates of birth, mailing addresses, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers and financial information, according to the email. The company has not found any identity theft related to the breach.

summary = Q Link Wireless, a provider of low-cost mobile phone and data services to 2 million US-based customers, has been making sensitive account data available to anyone who knows a valid phone number on the carrier’s network, an analysis of the company’s account management app shows.

summary = In July this year, Security Discovery researcher Bob Diachenko came across a plethora of JSON records in an exposed Elasticsearch cluster that piqued his interest. The 1.9 million-strong recordset contained sensitive information on people, including their names, country citizenship, gender, date of birth, passport details, and no-fly status.  The exposed server was indexed by search engines Censys and ZoomEye, indicating Diachenko may not have been the only person to come across the list: Additionally, the researcher noticed some elusive fields such as "tag," "nomination type," and "selectee indicator," that weren't immediately understood by him.  "That was the only valid guess given the nature of data plus there was a specific field named 'TSC_ID'," Diachenko told BleepingComputer, which hinted to him the source of the recordset could be the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC).  FBI's TSC is used by multiple federal agencies to manage and share consolidated information for counterterrorism purposes.  The agency maintains the classified watchlist called the Terrorist Screening Database, sometimes also referred to as the "no-fly list."  Such databases are regarded as highly sensitive in nature, considering the vital role they play in aiding national security and law enforcement tasks.

summary = FujiFilm is investigating a ransomware attack and has shut down portions of its network to prevent the attack's spread.  FujiFilm, also known as just Fuji, is a Japanese multinational conglomerate headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, which initially started in optical film and cameras. It has grown to include pharmaceuticals, storage devices, photocopiers and printers (XEROX), and digital cameras. Today, FUJIFILM announced that their Tokyo headquarters suffered a cyberattack Tuesday night that they indicate is a ransomware attack.  "FUJIFILM Corporation is currently carrying out an investigation into possible unauthorized access to its server from outside of the company. As part of this investigation, the network is partially shut down and disconnected from external correspondence," FUJIFILM said in a statement.  "We want to state what we understand as of now and the measures that the company has taken. In the late evening of June 1, 2021, we became aware of the possibility of a ransomware attack. As a result, we have taken measures to suspend all affected systems in coordination with our various global entities."  "We are currently working to determine the extent and the scale of the issue. We sincerely apologize to our customers and business partners for the inconvenience this has caused."  Due to the partial network outage, FUJIFILM USA has added an alert to the top of their website stating that they are experiencing network problems that are impacting their email and phone systems. While Fujifilm is keeping tight-lipped on further details, such as the identity of the ransomware used in the attack, Bleeping Computer reports that the company’s servers have been infected by Qbot. Advanced Intel CEO Vitali Kremez told the publication that the company’s systems were hit by the 13-year-old Trojan, typically initiated by phishing, last month.  The creators of Qbot, also known as QakBot or QuakBot, have a long history of partnering with ransomware operators. It previously worked with the ProLock and Egregor ransomware gangs, but is currently said to be linked with the notorious REvil group.  “Initial forensic analysis suggests that the ransomware attack on Fujifilm started with a Qbot trojan infection last month, which gave hackers a foothold in the company’s systems with which to deliver the secondary ransomware payload,” Ray Walsh, digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy, told TechCrunch. “Most recently, the Qbot trojan has been actively exploited by the REvil hacking collective, and it seems highly plausible that the Russian-based hackers are behind this cyberattack.”  REvil, also known as Sodinokibi, not only encrypts a victim’s files but also exfiltrates data from their network. The hackers typically threaten to publish the victim’s files if their ransom isn’t paid. But a site on the dark web used by REvil to publicize stolen data appeared offline at the time of writing.  Ransomware attacks have been on the rise since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, so much so that they have become the biggest single money earner for cybercriminals. Threat hunting and cyber intelligence firm Group-IB estimates that the number of ransomware attacks grew by more than 150% in 2020, and that the average ransom demand increased more than twofold to $170,000.  At the time of writing, it’s unclear whether Fujifilm has paid any ransom to the hackers responsible for the attack on its systems.

summary = Full-service home medical equipment firm, Health Aid of Ohio in Parma, OH, has learned that unauthorized people obtained access to its networks and stolen a number of files. The data breach was identified on February 19, 2021 after noticing suspicious system activity. Health Aid of Ohio immediately took steps to get rid of the attackers from its network and protect all patient data.  A breach investigation affirmed that the attacker got access to files and exfiltrated them from Health Aid’s systems, nevertheless, it cannot be confirmed exactly which files were obtained from its networks. It is likely that a number of the exfiltrated files contained VA plan members’ protected health information (PHI).  The data possibly compromised included names, telephone numbers, addresses, and details of the type of equipment delivered to homes or was set up in people’s residences. The PHI of individuals who received services through their insurance company or healthcare provider included names, telephone numbers, birth dates, details of insurance, Social Security numbers, diagnosis information, and type of equipment.  Though the above-mentioned information could have been stolen, so far, Health Aid of Ohio did not receive any report that indicates any misuse of the compromised information. data.  Health Aid of Ohio has not discussed how the attackers acquired access to its systems and whether the attackers used malware or ransomware. However, it has already notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and appropriate authorities. The breach report submitted to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights indicates that about 141,149 individuals were probably impacted.

summary = Independent research shop Hedgeye has filed a lawsuit against one of its former employees-turned-competitors, Darius Dale, alleging that Dale stole trade secrets from the company. Dale has since started his own research firm, called 42 Macro LLC.  According to Dale's LinkedIn, he worked for Hedgeye for 11 years and 9 months, most recently as a managing director.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, is allegedly "to prevent the further trade secret misappropriation by a departing senior employee."  It accuses Dale, upon his resignation from Hedgeye on March 28, 2021, of copying "dozens of computer files comprising gigabytes of information from his company computer to a private Dropbox account" and then "using those files, sophisticated financial models refined by Hedgeye over more than 10 years, in a competing business that he created prior to his departure from Hedgeye".  The suit also accuses Dale of taking "Hedgeye’s client list and is pitching his new business directly to Hedgeye’s clients."  The accusations appear to center around Hedgeye's proprietary GIP model, which the lawsuit alleges Dale claimed he was "the inventor" of.  "Mr. Dale was a college senior, not part of the workforce, when Hedgeye was founded in 2008. Hedgeye’s GIP model, the cornerstone of the firm, had been fully developed by the time Mr. Dale was hired, 18 months later, as a junior analyst straight out of school without any work experience," the lawsuit alleges.  Darius' current LinkedIn profile says that his new firm "leverages Darius Dale's "Quantatmental" framework to help investors make informed asset allocation and portfolio construction decisions."  The suit also accuses Dale of destroying Hedgeye files:  In fact, Mr. Dale took one critical file that Hedgeye has not been able to recover. In other words, Mr. Dale did not just “copy” that file, he actually destroyed Hedgeye’s only copy. The file, named “PRICE VOLUME VOLATILITY.xlsx,” is a dynamic source model which took years to develop, and which contains and constitutes Hedgeye’s proprietary and confidential information and trade secrets.  Hedgeye also filed a temporary restraining order, asking Dale to preserve and deliver the Hedgeye computer files in question. The order was granted:  Dale took to Twitter to defend himself, stating:  We will continue to follow the story as details become available.

summary = A US telemarketing company has leaked the personal details of potentially tens of thousands of consumers after misconfiguring a cloud storage bucket, Infosecurity can reveal.  A team at vpnMentor led by Noam Rotem found the unsecured AWS S3 bucket on December 24 last year. It was traced to Californian business CallX, whose analytics services are apparently used by clients to improve their media buying and inbound marketing.  According to its website, the firm counts lending marketplace Lendingtree, Liberty Mutual Insurance and smart security vendor Vivint among its customers.  Rotem found 114,000 files left publicly accessibly in the leaky bucket. Most of these were audio recordings of phone conversations between CallX clients and their customers, which were being tracked by the firm’s marketing software. An additional 2000 transcripts of text chats were also viewable.  Personally identifiable information (PII) contained in these files included full names, home addresses, phone numbers and more.  With the leaked data, attackers could launch convincing phishing, fraud and vishing attacks, warned vpnMentor.

summary = Havoc creates amongst the users when the data breach was discovered via default permissions settings in Microsoft power apps, the data breach leads to an exposure of around 38 million users’ data. COVID-19 vaccination status, Social Security numbers, and email addresses are all likely to be exploited in the reported data breach.  The news was confirmed by Cyber security researchers. Researchers at UpGuard are aware of the data breach since May but they exposed this data breach publicly on Monday as earlier they were unsure of the severity of the data leaked. Not only common people but the data of government entities belong to different countries are also rumored to be leaked including Indiana, Maryland, and New York City.  When talking about private companies the data of American Airlines, J.B. Hunt, and Microsoft are also attacked in this data breach. Most of the low code”, cloud-hosted business intelligence applications are created using Microsoft Power apps as it ensures both internal as well as external users a secure access to their data. Power Apps UI also assists us built a website offering features including user authentication, forms for users to enter data, data transformation logic, storage of structured data, and APIs to retrieve that data by other applications. Although, even after discovering all this information still no evidence has been found regarding the data breach.  Moreover, it has also not been discovered yet how a cyber attacker was entered into a Microsoft power app’s system. In the past few years, cyber attack cases are at a boom and according to UpGuard, the data breach could be a great lesson for the tech companies to strengthen their system against massive cyber attacks.  Meanwhile, to protect their platforms against Data breaches both Microsoft and Google recently announces to spend around $10 billion to $20 billion for the next five years.

summary = FREEPORT — The town’s municipal computer network is back up and running after a cyberattack one week ago that has been linked to Russian criminals and a global ransomware group, the town manager said Tuesday.  Logically, a national information technology provider based in Portland, brought down the town’s network around 1 p.m. on June 8 after it detected a cyberattack, Town Manager Peter Joseph said. While the move successfully contained the attack, it shut down phone and online communications and disrupted municipal services across every department.  The attack came with a ransom note directing the town to pay $10,000 in cryptocurrency through Avaddon, a ransomware group responsible for numerous malware incidents since 2020, Joseph said. The town didn’t respond to the note, paid no ransom and experienced no data breach, he said.  “Our opinion is the attack was only partly successful and was stopped early,” Joseph said, emphasizing that no sensitive data was released, including that of town residents. Joseph said the attack has been reported to the Maine State Police Computer Crimes Unit, but no one had contacted him yet to investigate the incident. Exactly who was behind the attack is unclear, Joseph said, but it is believed to be a criminal operation based in Russia or a neighboring republic.  Bleeping Computer, a tech news website, reported Friday that Avaddon had shut down its ransomware, likely because of increasing pressure by police agencies and governments worldwide, as well as President Biden’s plan to discuss cyberattacks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva on Wednesday.

BY KELLEY BOUCHARDSTAFF WRITER Sharefacebooktweetredditemailprint8 COMMENTS FREEPORT — The town’s municipal computer network is back up and running after a cyberattack one week ago that has been linked to Russian criminals and a global ransomware group, the town manager said Tuesday.  Logically, a national information technology provider based in Portland, brought down the town’s network around 1 p.m. on June 8 after it detected a cyberattack, Town Manager Peter Joseph said. While the move successfully contained the attack, it shut down phone and online communications and disrupted municipal services across every department.  The attack came with a ransom note directing the town to pay $10,000 in cryptocurrency through Avaddon, a ransomware group responsible for numerous malware incidents since 2020, Joseph said. The town didn’t respond to the note, paid no ransom and experienced no data breach, he said.  “Our opinion is the attack was only partly successful and was stopped early,” Joseph said, emphasizing that no sensitive data was released, including that of town residents.  RELATED Freeport municipal offices disrupted by cyberattack Joseph said the attack has been reported to the Maine State Police Computer Crimes Unit, but no one had contacted him yet to investigate the incident. Exactly who was behind the attack is unclear, Joseph said, but it is believed to be a criminal operation based in Russia or a neighboring republic.  Bleeping Computer, a tech news website, reported Friday that Avaddon had shut down its ransomware, likely because of increasing pressure by police agencies and governments worldwide, as well as President Biden’s plan to discuss cyberattacks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva on Wednesday.  Advertisement  Freeport’s cyberattack is the latest on a municipal computer network in Maine and one of a growing number of similar incidents.  The Presque Isle Police Department was hit by an Avaddon ransomware attack that came to light in April, when the town refused to pay a ransom and hackers dumped 200 gigabytes of data on the dark web. And when the Rockport Town Office was hit in 2018, municipal officials also didn’t pay a ransom and IT staff worked throughout the weekend to restore encrypted data.  While larger malware incidents like the recent Colonial Pipeline hack get a lot of attention, attacks on smaller targets wreak havoc, too, and many don’t make it into the news. The FBI receives two to three reports each week of ransomware attacks in Maine, The Associated Press reported.  Joseph said the town had security systems to detect the cyberattack and the municipal network was not disabled by the attack.  Freeport town offices remained open as usual during the phone and internet outage, but it made many basic municipal functions inconvenient or impossible, such as paying property taxes with a credit card or using the computerized book catalog at the public library.  Residents were still able to call for emergency assistance from Freeport’s police and fire departments by dialing 911 because the neighboring town of Brunswick has dispatched emergency services for Freeport for several years.

summary = Hacktivist collective Anonymous claims to have obtained gigabytes of data from Epik, which provides domain name, hosting, and DNS services for a variety of clients. These include the Texas GOP, Gab, Parler, and 8chan, among other right-wing sites. The stolen data has been released as a torrent. The hacktivist collective says that the data set, which is over 180GB in size, contains a “decade’s worth of data from the company.”  Anonymous says the data set is “all that’s needed to trace actual ownership and management of the fascist side of the Internet that has eluded researchers, activists, and, well, just about everybody.” Epik has now confirmed that an "unauthorized intrusion" did in fact occur into its systems. The announcement follows last week's incident of hacktivist collective Anonymous leaking 180 GB of data stolen from online service provider Epik. To mock the company's initial response to the data breach claims, Anonymous had altered Epik's official knowledge base, as reported by Ars.  Epik is a domain registrar and web services provider known to serve right-wing clients, some of which have been turned down by more mainstream IT providers due to the objectionable and sometimes illicit content hosted by the clients. Epik's clients have included the Texas GOP, Parler, Gab, and 8chan, among others.  Epik hack impacts millions of non-customers, too Turns out, the leaked data dump contains 15,003,961 email addresses belonging to both Epik's customers and non-customers, and not everyone is pleased with the news. This occurred as Epik had scraped WHOIS records of domains, even those not owned by the company, and stored these records. In doing so, the contact information of those who have never transacted with Epik directly was also retained in Epik's systems.  FURTHER READING Anonymous leaks gigabytes of data from alt-right web host Epik Data breach monitoring service HaveIBeenPwned has now begun sending out alerts to their subscribers whose email addresses were exposed in the Epik hack. The service's founder, Troy Hunt, is one of the many impacted by the data breach but who "had absolutely nothing to do with Epik."  In a poll last week, Hunt had asked if affected users who weren't Epik customers preferred receiving breach alerts as well. The majority of users responded affirmatively to the question.

summary = Foodservice supplier Edward Don has suffered a ransomware attack that has caused the company to shut down portions of the network to prevent the attack's spread.  Edward Don and Company is one of the largest distributors of foodservice equipment and supplies, such as kitchen supplies, bar supplies, flatware, and dinnerware. Today, BleepingComputer has learned that Edward Don suffered a ransomware attack earlier this week that has disrupted their business operations, including their phone systems, network, and email. The email outage has caused employees to use Gmail accounts to communicate with customers regarding urgent orders or fulfillment issues.  Edward Don has not publicly disclosed the attack at this time, but employees have stated that they cannot accept new orders until the systems are brought back online.  As Edward Don is one of the leading distributors of food service supplies, this attack will cause a significant disruption in the supply chain for hospitals, restaurants, hotels, and bars.  BleepingComputer has attempted to contacted Edward Don but has not received a reply. At this time, it is not clear what ransomware operation has conducted the attack.  However, Advanced Intel CEO Vitali Kremez has told BleepingComputer that company may have been infected by the Qbot malware based on their adversarial visibility.  Qbot is known to partner with ransomware operations to provide them remote access to infected networks. Ransomware gangs use this remote access to spread laterally through a network, steal data, and ultimately deploy the ransomware to encrypt devices.

summary = A cybercriminal working for Iran attacked the computer of a former IDF chief of staff and gained access to his entire computer database, says Times of Israel.    Channel 10 identified the hacker as Yaser Balaghi. He reportedly bragged about the hack afterward, but also unknowingly left a trail of his identity. This oversight forced Iran to shut down the cyber operation that had targeted 1,800 people worldwide, including Israeli army generals, Persian Gulf human rights defenders, and academics.  The Times of Israel first reported on the Iranian hacking operation two weeks ago after Check Point, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, revealed its existence. Check Point information was also highlighted in a Channel 10 report on Tuesday. The CEO of Check Point Software Technologies, Gil Shwed, told Israel Radio in late January that the attack began two months earlier and that targets received email messages aimed at installing malware on their computers.  More than a quarter of the recipients opened the emails, unintentionally downloading spyware and allowing the hackers to steal data from their hard drives.  In the last two years, Hezbollah and the Iranian regime attacked Israel several times  Several cyberattacks have been launched against Israel in the last two years. According to officials, some of the infiltration efforts were carried out by hackers associated with Hezbollah and the Iranian government.  In late January, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz stated that Israel's Electric Authority was the subject of a serious cyberattack. However, he did not specify where the attack was coming from.  In June, the Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky announced that it had detected a continuous wave of cyberattacks originating from Iran against targets in Israel and in the Middle East, with Israeli generals again among the targets. According to the company, the purpose is espionage or other nation-state interests.  According to ClearSky, the hackers use techniques such as targeted phishing, in which they employ fake websites that appear legitimate and trustworthy to obtain user identification data. They managed to penetrate 40 targets in Israel and 500 internationally. In Israel, the targets included retired generals, employees of security consulting firms, and academic scholars.  Shwed warned that the rate of cyberattacks exceeds the rate of investment in cybersecurity.  According to Gadi Tirosh, the managing partner of Jerusalem Venture Partners and one of the country's most active investors in the industry, Israel is second only to the US in cybersecurity technology.  Currently, there are 173 companies in Israel that are large enough to attract venture capital and other major investors. According to a report released earlier this month by the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, there are currently 430 cyber companies in Israel, with an average of 52 new cyber startups launched each year since 2000.

summary = About 1 million people’s information was stolen in a cyberattack targeting the municipality of Konya in central Turkey, media reports claimed.  A municipality official confirmed the attack but did not disclose its scale. The Sözcü newspaper claims the ID numbers and other personal information of about 1 million people were stolen in the cyberattack, predominantly those who had sent emails to the municipality. A suspect using the user name Maxim Gorki put a database containing the information on a hacker forum.  Municipality officials told the newspaper that law enforcement had been notified about the attack, which took place on March 29. “Our municipality is frequently subject to cyberattacks. The latest attack had access to access logs of public data published on our websites and had access to a limited number of email addresses and phone numbers,” the official said.  In March, Yemeksepeti, the country’s leading online food delivery website that serves more than 19 million customers and has more than 35,000 eateries on its platform, was subject to a similar cyberattack. The personal data, like birth dates and phone numbers, of an undisclosed number of Yemeksepeti users were stolen in the attack.  Both private and public entities in the country often face attacks online that range from data theft and extortion schemes to simple direct denial of service

There was a cyber attack on the Neuchâtel Cantonal Bank (BCN) at the beginning of August, spokeswoman Marie-Laure Chapatte, told the «AWP» news agency (in German), resulting in the potential theft of around 1,500 email addresses.  Neither the banking infrastructure - such as the online banking platform - nor other sensitive systems were affected by the attack on August 4 and 5, the bank added.   BCN said the attack was «contained quickly». There was also no attempt at extortion or ransom demands as in ransomware attacks.  Nothing of Value Taken?  The attackers succeeded in exploiting a vulnerability in the BCN website that has since been dealt with. An external expert was brought in to analyze the situation more thoroughly.  «The bank believes it is adequately protected from the threat of a cyber-attack,» the spokeswoman said.  Some of the information that the hackers accessed was old and dates back to 2012.  «Due to the poor quality of the data, we were unable to contact those potentially affected because we could not always identify them,» Chapatte added.  That sounds alarming, but all in all the bank thinks it is in a position to identify those potentially affected.  The BCN revealed the incident on its website last week.

summary = SINGAPORE — A police sergeant was charged on Thursday (2 September) for allegedly seeking a romantic relationship with a female individual, in exchange for helping her with her case.  Singaporean Sean Teo, 25, was handed a charge each under the Computer Misuse Act, Official Secrets Act and Prevention of Corruption Act.  These are for accessing data regarding to individuals arrested in the Singapore Police Force system without authority; for sending a photo he received from a police operation to the woman he wanted a relationship with; and for soliciting a relationship with her in exchange for helping her with her Central Narcotics Bureau case.  Teo allegedly misused a SPF computer system on 2 November 2019, in order to access the data of individuals who were arrested in a police operation via an incident report.  On 8 December, while at a playground along Jurong West Street 61, Teo allegedly had in his possession a photograph relating to the 2 November police operation. He is said to have sent this photo to the woman, whose name cannot be revealed due to a gag order.

summary = Howard University announced Monday that they are investigating a ransomware attack.  According to school officials, their information technology team detected unusual activity on the school’s network last Friday.  Due to the unusual activity, the school’s Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) intentionally shut down the university’s network to investigate. WASHINGTON D.C. (7News) — Howard University announced Monday that they are investigating a ransomware attack and canceled classes Tuesday. Now, university officials are canceling online and hybrid classes Wednesday, too. In-person classes will take place.  According to school officials, their information technology team detected unusual activity on the school's network last Friday.  Due to the unusual activityOnline and hybrid classes will be canceled again Wednesday so that the IT team has more time to investigate the incident. The campus will be open to essential employees only.  "This is a highly dynamic situation, and it is our priority to protect all sensitive personal, research, and clinical data. We are in contact with the FBI and the D.C. city government, and we are installing additional safety measures to further protect the University’s and your personal data from any criminal ciphering," university officials say.  Howard sophomore Tahir Scott expressed his frustration with having no WIFI, saying he cannot do homework as often because so much of it is online. “[We were told to] change our password, check our user name make sure nobody’s trying to use it to log in,” Scott said.  Allan Liska, a senior intelligence analysist for the cyber security firm, Recorded Future, says ransomware attacks frequently occur around holidays, noting the Colonial Pipeline attack that took place on Mother's Day weekend.  “Colleges and universities have become much more attractive to ransomware groups because they can demand higher payment," Liska said. Recorded Future says this is the 20th attack against a college or university just this year.  The school shared this information with its community:  All online and hybrid undergraduate courses remain suspended for tomorrow, Wednesday, September 8, and the physical campus will be open to essential employees only. All in-person undergraduate, graduate, professional, and clinical experiential courses will resume as scheduled tomorrow, Wednesday, September 8.

Faculty with alternative Wi-Fi connection options (i.e. hot spots), will be able to access online academic modules and apps, and can coordinate class convening via university-approved platform The add/drop deadline for courses will be extended. Specific details will be provided once confirmation of BisonWeb and Wi-Fi access for students on campus is provided. For your convenience:  Both dining halls will remain open. Nonessential employees are expected to remain home. Some apps are accessible.

summary = A Chinese game developer has accidentally leaked nearly six million player profiles for the popular title Battle for the Galaxy after misconfiguring a cloud database, Infosecurity has learned.  AMT Games, which has produced a string of mobile and social titles with tens of millions of downloads between them, exposed 1.5TB of data via an Elasticsearch server.  A research team at reviews site WizCase found the trove, which contained 5.9 million player profiles, two million transactions, and 587,000 feedback messages.  Profiles typically feature player IDs, usernames, country, total money spent on the game, and Facebook, Apple or Google account data if the user linked these with their game account.  Feedback messages contain account IDs, feedback ratings and users' email addresses. At the same time, transaction data includes price, item purchased, time of purchase, payment provider, and sometimes buyer IP addresses, according to WizCase.  The firm warned exposed users that their data might have been picked up by opportunistic cyber-criminals searching for misconfigured databases. Data on how much money individuals have spent on the site could enable fraudsters to target the biggest spenders, it added.  WizCase warned that "it is common for unethical hackers and criminals on the internet to use personal data to create trustworthy phishing emails. The more information they possess, the more believable these emails look."  It went on add that confidential information such as email addresses and user issues with the service could enable bad actors to "pose as game support and direct users to malicious websites where their credit card details can be stolen."  The firm urged gamers to input the minimum amount of personal information possible when purchasing or setting up an account and parents not to lend children their credit cards.  WizCase said it reached out to AMT Games with news of the data breach but did not receive a response. The company later disabled access to the database.

summary = Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C., on Friday revealed it had a breach of patient and donor information last fall.  In a notice posted to its website, the organization revealed that it found “unusual” activity on its networks on Sept. 3. At that time, it began securing its systems, started an investigation and notified law enforcement.  “Nothing is more important to us than our patients’ privacy,” the notice said. “We have extensive security measures in place, and we continuously take steps to enhance the security of our systems and the data entrusted to us. We will also continue to assist law enforcement’s efforts to identify and prosecute the perpetrators of this incident.”  On Oct. 21, the investigation determined that “unauthorized actors gained access to [the] network.” It also revealed that the data breach, which occurred from Aug. 27 to Oct. 8, impacted only the D.C. branch. PPMW indicated that confidential data was breached during the incident when the hackers acquired copies of documents that contained patient information. Leaked information included names, addresses, dates of birth, diagnoses, treatments and prescription information. Social Security and financial information was also included in the breach. Joshua Speiser, director of communications for PPMW, said the breach affected a limited number of its patients but did not provide a more specific figure.  The notice did not mention that donors were compromised in the breach but those affected also received letters. Check images with a donor’s name, bank account number and routing number were among the documents included in the leak.  On April 9, PPMW began mailing letters to affected patients about whom they could reach for guidance on further protecting their information. The findings of the investigation found “no reason to suspect that there has been any fraudulent use of patient information associated with this incident.” However, the organization is providing patients whose Social Security and driver’s license numbers were compromised with complimentary credit monitoring and identity-theft protection services. Donors with compromised bank information did not receive the same service offer.  The organization has been working with law enforcement to continue investigating who committed the breach, but Speiser said they have “no indication PPMW was specifically targeted because of the work we do.”

summary = A user on a popular hacker forum is selling three databases that purportedly contain user credentials and device data stolen from three different Android VPN services – SuperVPN, GeckoVPN, and ChatVPN – with 21 million user records being sold in total. The VPN services whose data has been allegedly exfiltrated by the hacker are SuperVPN, which is considered as one of the most popular (and dangerous) VPNs on Google Play with 100,000,000+ installs on the Play store, as well as GeckoVPN (1,000,000+ installs) and ChatVPN (50,000+ installs).  The forum user is selling deeply sensitive device data and login credentials – email addresses and randomly generated strings used as passwords – of more than 21 million VPN users for an undisclosed sum.   We reached out to SuperVPN, GeckoVPN, and ChatVPN and asked the providers if they could confirm that the leak was genuine but we have received no responses at the time of writing this report. The author of the forum post is selling three archives, two of which allegedly contain a variety of data apparently collected by the providers from more than 21,000,000 SuperVPN, GeckoVPN, and ChatVPN users, including:  Email addresses Usernames Full names Country names Randomly generated password strings Payment-related data Premium member status and its expiration date The forum post author is also offering potential buyers to sort the data by country. The random password strings might indicate that the VPN user accounts could be linked with their Google Play store accounts where the users downloaded their VPN apps from.

summary = A group of hackers that claims to have infiltrated the computer servers of the National Lottery (Lotenal) has threatened to reveal confidential information if the agency refuses to cooperate with it.  A criminal group claims to have accessed Lotenal’s servers last Thursday using Avaddon ransomware, malicious software (also known as malware) that has been used in numerous cyberattacks in several countries.  The group demanded the payment of a ransom within 10 days in exchange for not leaking information it stole. The amount it is asking for is unknown. “… We have data such as all contracts and agreements from 2009 to 2021, legal documents, correspondence, finance, notarial data, outsourcing, and much more,” the group said in a statement published online. “Also remember that data cannot be decrypted without our general decryptor. And your site will be attacked by a DDoS [distributed denial of service] attack,” it said.  Lotenal has neither confirmed nor denied that it was the victim of a cyberattack. It said on Friday that it was updating its systems and that this was causing some interruptions to its online services. On Saturday, the criminal group published another statement. “Apparently the [agency] does not quite understand the seriousness of this situation and wants to hide the fact that they were hacked and we stole data from their servers,” it said.  “… What if we say that we have a lot of confidential data (see photo below), such as sexual harassment in the workplace, unpleasant incidents and a lot of dirt associated with your [agency]? If you continue to lie to everyone and do not contact us on this fact, then we, in turn, are ready to surprise all who follow the news related to our blow to your companies with very interesting documents that we have.”  The group published an image of a redacted federal government document about a case in which a Lotenal cleaner was a victim of sexual harassment. According to Hiram Caramillo, co-founder and director of information security at the cybersecurity consulting firm Seekurity, groups that use ransomware such as Avaddon are “criminals that earn millions of dollars” through extortion.  He said that Lotenal should be working to ensure that Avaddon ransomware is no longer being used to infiltrate its systems. Caramillo also said the lottery agency must identify what information has been stolen.  “It’s not the first time that a company that has been hacked denies the attack,” he said, referring to Lotenal’s decision not to publicly acknowledge the cyberattack. Nor is it the first time that ransomware groups respond to companies that refuse to cooperate, he said. “The same situation has already happened several times,” Caramillo said.  According to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Avaddon ransomware was first advertised on Russian-language hacking forums as a ransomware-as-a-service, or RaaS, product. Raas refers to the sale of malware to would-be hackers via a subscription model. Hackers that do not have the skills to write and deliver their own ransomware code to victims can do so by buying Raas products on the dark web. The ransomware developers typically get a cut of the victim’s payment.  According to the cybersecurity research company Group-IB, almost two-thirds of ransomware attacks worldwide that it analyzed during 2020 came from cybercriminals operating on a RaaS model.

summary = U.S. Air Force airmen studying for service tests inadvertently leaked highly classified details about American nuclear weapons for the entire world to see, according to a new report. The airmen exposed the information—including which storage bunkers at European military bases likely held nuclear weapons, as well as secret signals to indicate duress—through sets of online flash cards.  The good news? Although the information could have theoretically helped someone stealing a nuke, built-in safety features would have prevented them from actually using the weapon. But still. According to a researcher at the open source intelligence group Bellingcat, Europe-based airmen who were charged with protecting six U.S. bases’ nuclear weapons uploaded secrets to flashcard learning apps online. The flashcards included classified information to help the airmen pass qualification tests. The bases included Aviano and Ghedi Air Bases in Italy, Incirlik Air Base (Turkey) Volkel Air Base (the Netherlands), Kleine Brogel (Belgium), and Büchel (Germany). According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the six bases house a total of 100 B61-3 and B61-4 tactical nuclear bombs.  The B61-3 is an aircraft-delivered gravity bomb with an adjustable explosive yield, starting at just 300 tons of TNT. Other yields include 1.5 kilotons (1,500 tons of TNT), and go all the way up to 170 kilotons. For reference, the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima, Japan in August 1945 had a yield of 16 kilotons. The leaked information reportedly included how many “vaults,” or nuclear storage bunkers, were located on bases. Additionally, the details revealed which vaults at one base were “hot” (likely storing a live nuclear weapon), and which were “cold” (empty). The flashcards also included locations of security cameras, unique identifiers on special security badges carried by base personnel, and even secret duress words. Other sensitive information on Europe-based tactical nuclear weapons also appeared on social media. In one case, a group Facebook photo from the Volkel-based 703rd Munitions Support Squadron allowed researchers to determine the exact location and name of the vault where the photo was taken.  Researchers were also able to identify the “bomb” in the photo as a dummy version of a B61 bomb. This strongly suggests the vault normally stored a dummy bomb—information that adversaries could use to deduce which vaults at the base held real bombs.  The B61s are the last nuclear gravity bombs that U.S. and NATO tactical aircraft carry. In the event of war, the bombs located at Volkel, for example, would be loaded onto Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 fighter jets stationed at the base. Here's a 2018 test of the B61-12, the latest version of the long-serving bomb, involving a U.S. Air Force F-16:

summary = FARMINGTON — A Farmington hospital has reported a data breach to its network in Fall 2020 that impacted more than 500 patients whose personal information was taken.  The hospital said in a statement there is no evidence of any personal information being misused from the data breach.  San Juan Regional Medical Center sent out letters dated June 4 to patients stating a “recent data security incident” may have involved their personal information.  San Juan County COVID-19 vaccine tracker:45% of people fully vaccinated  The letter states on Sept. 8, 2020, the hospital identified unauthorized access to its computer network.  Patient account numbers, medical record numbers and medical diagnosis/medical treatment information was obtained.  “San Juan Regional Medical Center is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information in their possession and have taken many precautions to safeguard it,” the hospital said in an emailed statement. The impacted information of more than 500 patients included:  Names Dates of birth Social Security numbers Driver’s license numbers Financial account numbers Health insurance information Medical information The information was taken from billing records or documents related to billing. The hospital’s electronic medical record system was not impacted.  Those billing records sometimes contain information tied to a patient’s treatment or medical diagnosis. The patient account number is an internal number that is used to match a patient with billing services. To date, we have no evidence that any of the personal information has been misused. The notification letters were sent to make individuals aware of the incident and provide guidance on what individuals can do to further protect themselves,” the hospital said in a statement.

The database exposed the names of various people involved in sensitive criminal, domestic-abuse or child-custody court cases, related to a county in Illinois.  Researchers from Website Planet (in conjunction with security researcher Jeremiah Fowler) said they don’t know who owns the exposed database in question. The data is related to Cook County, home to the city of Chicago and which has 5.1 million residents (making it the second most populous county in the U.S., behind Los Angeles county), they said.  “On January 29th, 2021, the Cook County Bureau of Technology reached out to us to inform us that the server did not belong to the Cook County government,” said researchers with Website Planet in an update on Jan. 31. “The owner of the server was still unknown as of that day.”

Also set for sentencing that day are retired educator Gregory Corkren and former football coach David "Webb" Tutt, who joined Sisk in pleading guilty in April to their roles in a multiyear scheme to obtain funding using fraudulent school enrollment figures.  The other three indicted in the case are Trey Holladay, former Athens City Schools superintendent; Deborah Holladay, his wife and former ACS educator; and Rick Carter, who served as the ACS director of innovative programs until he was placed on administrative leave in February.  Together, the six used their roles within the public education system or as small business owners to foster a scheme in which private school students were enrolled as ACS or LCS virtual students, in most cases without the students' or their parents' knowledge. The increase in enrollment then allowed the school districts to receive additional funding from the state.  Meanwhile, Corkren's company received nearly $2 million from ACS and LCS for "student services," records show. According to the indictment and Corkren's plea agreement, that money was then passed along to other members in the scheme in the form of payments to their companies, payments for vehicle repairs and, in one case, a gift-wrapped shoebox with cash inside.  For their roles, Sisk, Corkren and Tutt were each charged with one count of conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud. Corkren faced an additional charge of aggravated identity theft. Each has pleaded guilty and remains out on bond until sentencing.  Trial for the Holladays and Carter is set for Feb. 7, 2022, nearly two months before the sentencing hearing. Each is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit mail/wire fraud. In addition, Trey Holladay faces 88 counts of wire fraud and 35 counts of aggravated identity theft; Deborah Holladay faces six counts of wire fraud; and Carter faces 86 counts of wire fraud and 34 counts of aggravated identity theft.
